To run this app there are two method

1.
first go the parent folder of the bookeh_app and run this command...
    bokeh serve --show bookeh_app --port 5006
this will open a server by running the main.py inside this folder and host the app
this will use the database out of the given folder and hence the path in main.py has different folder than flaskDemo.py as it
follows a different format

just make sure you have an entry saved for the current day before running the server otherwise it will throw an error

2.
second method is prefered one and through the flask server but sometime it behaved randomly as there are two server redirecting
each other and bookeh is hosted inside the flask server

for this method just run the flaskDemo class and it should work
take note that database location here is ./ so that it referrs to same database which has the data..
